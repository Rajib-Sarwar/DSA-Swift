#### Problem Description
You have a set of non-overlapping intervals. You are given a new interval [start, end], insert this new interval into the set of intervals (merge if necessary).
You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.


#### Problem Constraints
```
0 <= |intervals| <= 105
```

#### Input Format
First argument is the vector of intervals
second argument is the new interval to be merged


#### Output Format
Return the vector of intervals after merging


#### Example Input
```
Input 1:
Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 5] .
Input 2:
Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 6] .
```

#### Example Output
```
Output 1:
 [ [1, 5], [6, 9] ]
Output 2:
 [ [1, 9] ]
```

#### Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
(2,5) does not completely merge the given intervals
Explanation 2:
(2,6) completely merges the given intervals
```
